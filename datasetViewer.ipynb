              So there was a bit more collaboration than that but it's the TLDR of it.  The only thing I didn't pick was the case, that was already settled.\\n\\nTried to scheme it out as well as I could for color.  Also had a budget to be mindful of and stayed within it.  Kept the RGB to a minimum as she's not a big fan of it so went subtle.\\n\\nRyzen 7 9700x\\nASRock x870 Pro RS AC\\n32GB Teamgroup DDR5 640mhz\\nCorsair RM850 White PSU\\nSamsung 990 Pro 2TB\\nPowercooler Hellhound 7800XT Sakura Edition\\nVetroo AL900 case\\nThermalright Grand Vision white 360mm AIO\\nThermalright TL-S12W and S12RW case and cooler fans.\\n\\nI'm impressed with the fans, running Thermalright fans on my kids computer and for the money they're outstanding.

struggling to hold on and learning how to deal with the constant, never ending deafening sound in my head and I saw this game called helldivers had just come out, I'd never been a gamer in my life but clips of this game were all over social media and I had 10 weeks of couch time ahead of me with recovery so l ordered a ps5 and helldivers, and when I say it saved my life, I legitimately mean it. \\n\\nIt was the perfect distraction to deal with the pain and the noise in my head and it was the only thing that gave me any respite from it all. It was the only time for an hour or two in the day that the noise became background noise and I was distracted and having fun.\\n\\n\\nEventually I met two people on there who I started gaming with for hours every day and now speak to them daily on the phone outside of gaming and consider them great friends. \\n\\nAnyway, I said long story short, my partner was super supportive through it all and encouraged me to get into it more as it really helped mentally and kinda brought me back to her and the world around me.\\n\\nChristmas rolls around this year and I unwrap a bunch of Xbox games (I said I wanted to try both consoles eventually as gaming is all super new to me) and I figure she's just got the wrong games by accident, which is fine as these things happen, but then she tells me to follow her into my gaming room and I find a giant 85 inch tv, PlayStation portal, and Xbox series x, a Samsung Q990d soundbar (not pictured) all wrapped up. \\n\\nSafe to say I was blown away. I know for some people it might not be the best tv for gaming or whatever but I'm just so glad I've found gaming and all the awesome connections and stuff that it brings and for my partner to fully embrace it and spoil me like this just really helped put an awesome cap on the end of a terrible year. Stoked I’ve discovered gaming and the awesome communities that come with it.   \n",
      "52  MAJOR UPDATE 6:20PM EST 08/02/2024: Intel, as a result of the backlash from this, has gotten back to me with a \"second review\" and determined that BOTH CPUs were indeed valid!!! Image here: [\\n\\nHi Everyone. I'm very disheartened to share this news as a longtime and loyal Intel customer. I've purchased roughly $20,000 worth of merchandise with them over my lifetime and I've never once had to open any RMA requests until now. Unfortunately, it's very clear they are not standing behind their products and I'm going to provide to ton of detail and pictures below on what happened involving TWO retail boxed 14900Ks, one purchased from Amazon on 10/16/2023 (this was the release date of the 14900K for anyone not in the know) which was shipped from and sold by [Amazon.com]( and one from Microcenter (brand new, not open box or anything like that, grabbed right off the shelf) on 02/11/2024, both experiencing the wide-spread instability issues.\\n\\nIntel has claimed that both products are \"re-marked\" and not genuine. The problem is that they definitely are not re-marked. They also tried to claim that one of them was a tray processor and thereby not subject to retail warranty, which they backtracked on, and then went the route of claiming it was re-marked.\\n\\nFull disclosure: Intel provided me with letters stating that the CPUs are not genuine and asked me to return them to their respective stores for a solution. I've done this and both stores, despite being WAY outside of return windows, DID refund me. Amazon gave me a full refund to my original payment method, and Microcenter gave me a full refund in store credit. In the end this worked out better for me, but that's beside the point. Now these two companies are having to shoulder the cost and burden of Intel's failure to take responsibility, and that's not right.\\n\\nThat being said, I'll be providing uncensored pictures of the retail boxes and CPUs which will show the full batch numbers and the full serial numbers. Since these CPUs are not in my possession anymore, and are ultimately going back to Intel, I feel it's fine to share them in their totality.\\n\\nHere's the details:\\n\\nThe processor purchased from Microcenter on 02/11/2024, partial serial 02096:\\n\\nI filled out the RMA form. Intel got back to me the next day admitting that the CPU was faulty. They then asked me for my shipping details and proof of purchase. I provided it. They then asked for pictures of the IHS. I provided it. Another day passes and they get back to me stating that the CPU is not genuine and is re-marked. WHAT!? This is news to me. This was purchased from a reputable retailer directly off the shelf. It was not open box, the seal was completely intact, and there was absolutely nothing suspicious about it. Furthermore, it showed correctly in CPU-Z as a 14900K and frequencies checked out, boosting to 6GHz single core and 5.7GHz all-core. I conveyed all of this information to Intel, and provided additional pictures of the IHS and the serial number just in case the previous pictures were too blurry. I also provided a picture of the retail box, clearly showing the full serial number and batch number, which did match the CPU. I also plugged in the batch number and serial number into Intel's warranty checker tool and it came back as valid with warranty until 2027. I took a screenshot of that and provided it as well. You can see all of those images in the image link below. They got back to me and said that their response hasn't changed and that they cannot divulge their investigation process. They insisted I return it to Microcenter with a letter they provided that it was not genuine. I did so, and Microcenter took a look. They said there was absolutely no evidence of tampering. The only thing they thought it might be was that there was some thermal paste still on the side of the CPU, and they said it made it look like it could have been delidded (however they confirmed it was NOT delidded). They suggested reporting their findings to Intel, and wiping away the paste and taking new pictures. I then reported those finding to Intel, to which they repeated that they cannot divulge the investigation process and they said that new pictures would not change their findings. It was at this point they told me I could continue with getting an RMA, but that if the chip was found to be re-marked they **WILL** retain and confiscate it. The exact verbiage was, \"We do not disclose our investigation practices. If you believe your products are valid and wish to proceed with a return merchandise authorization (RMA), we can create one. **However, if the products fail the validation process, the units will be retained and confiscated, and no replacements or refunds will be provided.** For this reason, we are giving you the option to take the letter and share it with the place of purchase. This will give you more possibilities to get a replacement since you have the processors in your possession.\" So, as you can see, they insisted I return it to Microcenter, so I did, and they graciously allowed me to return it for store credit.\\n\\nHere are all the relevant pictures for 02096, including Intel's letter claiming it is re-marked, original receipt, warranty checker from Intel, retail box, IHS, serial number close-up, a screenshot of the email where they threatened to confiscate the CPU, and a screenshot of their initial response via email: [\\n\\nThe processor purchased from Amazon on 10/16/2023, partial serial 03252:\\n\\nJust like the last RMA, I filled out the form, they got back to me, said the CPU was indeed confirmed as faulty, asked for my information and pictures, I provided it all. They got back to me and quoted back the WRONG serial number (I provided the correct one in the original form and the picture CLEARLY shows 03252). They quoted that I was talking about 03262. They went on to explain that 03262 is a tray processor and not subject to retail warranty. They suggested that I take it back to the OEM. I got back to them and stated that they were talking about the wrong serial number. I clearly provided 03252. They got back to me and said that the image appeared to be a 6 instead of a 5. At this point I provided closer-up pictures of the serial number and IHS as well as a picture of the retail box showing the matching serial numbers and batch numbers. It was at this point they backtracked and said that 03252 was indeed a retail box. They said I can proceed with the RMA BUT that they were not confident that it would pass fraud validation. He then pointed out, and I quote: \"\\n\\nWe have reviewed the new photos you provided and will approve the return of the device marked \"03252.\"\\n\\n* **However,** we are not fully convinced that it will pass the incoming fraud inspection at our depot. We strongly recommend that you return the product to your place of purchase.\\n* Please familiarize yourself with the Processor Warranty Terms and Conditions, as well as the warning at the bottom of the warranty information page: [Intel Warranty Info]( Specifically, \"**Please be advised as part of Intel's ongoing efforts to prevent fraud in the marketplace, in the event the product you submit for warranty support is found to be re-marked or otherwise fraudulent product, Intel reserves the rights to retain the product and/or destroy such product as appropriate**.\"\\n\\n\"\\n\\nAt least this time they said they reserve the right to retain or destroy it instead of saying they WILL. At this point I contacted Amazon to let them know what was going on. I can't stress how good Amazon is. They didn't even ask for any extra details or screenshots, they simply allowed me to return the CPU for a full refund to the original payment method despite being 9 months outside of the return window. Kudos to Amazon!\\n\\nHere are all the relevant images for 03252: [\\n\\nAt the end of the day, it felt like Intel was grasping at straws. They pounced at the opportunity to claim that one of the CPUs was a tray product, citing a serial number that was never even provided. Then when that didn't pan out, they pivoted to claiming it was re-marked. When I pressed them, giving several pieces of evidence for why each one was indeed valid, they stated I could continue with the RMA process but then turned to threatening me with confiscation or destruction of my property if it didn't meet whatever their validation process (that they won't disclose) is. The odds of both of these being re-marked or not genuine seem extremely low. It's definitely a scare tactic. And even knowing this, it worked on me! This feels like extortion, scamming, you name it.\\n\\nAnyway, I wanted to get all this out there. Everyone should know what they are doing!   \n",
